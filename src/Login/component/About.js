            Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences all related to
            a central topic, idea, or theme. Paragraphs act as structural tools
            for writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal progression,
            and they also help readers process those thoughts effortlessly.
            Imagine how much harder reading and writing would be if everything
            was just one long block of text. There’s a lot of flexibility when
            it comes to writing paragraphs, but if there’s one steadfast rule,
            it’s this: Paragraphs should relate to one main topic or point. The
            paragraph itself often contains multiple points spanning several
            sentences, but they should all revolve around one core theme. Just
            as sentences build upon each other to communicate the paragraph’s
            core theme, paragraphs work together to communicate the core theme
            of the writing as a whole. That’s the basic idea, but in practice
            there’s more to it. Let’s look at the four main types of paragraphs
            to learn how and when to use them.{" "}
