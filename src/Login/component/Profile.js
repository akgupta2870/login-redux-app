        Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences all related to a
        central topic, idea, or theme. Paragraphs act as structural tools for
        writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal progression, and they
        also help readers process those thoughts effortlessly. Imagine how much
        harder reading and writing would be if everything was just one long
        block of text. Thereâ€™s a lot of flexibility when it comes to them.{" "}
