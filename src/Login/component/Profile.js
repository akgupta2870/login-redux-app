          Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences all related to a
          central topic, idea, or theme. Paragraphs act as structural tools for
          writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal progression, and they
          also help readers process those thoughts effortlessly. Imagine how
          much harder reading and writing would be if everything was just one
          long block of text. Thereâ€™s a lot of flexibility when it comes to
          them.{" "}
