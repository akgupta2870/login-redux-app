          Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences all related to a
          central topic, idea, or theme. Paragraphs act as structural tools for
          writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal progression, and they
          also help readers process those thoughts effortlessly. Imagine how
          much harder reading and writing would be if everything was just one
          long block of text. There’s a lot of flexibility when it comes to
          writing paragraphs, but if there’s one steadfast rule, it’s this:
          Paragraphs should relate to one main topic or point. The paragraph
          itself often contains multiple points spanning several sentences, but
          they should all revolve around one core theme. Just as sentences build
          upon each other to communicate the paragraph’s core theme, paragraphs
          work together to communicate the core theme of the writing as a whole.
          That’s the basic idea, but in practice there’s more to it. Let’s look
          at the four main types of paragraphs to learn how and when to use
          them.{" "}
